# HTML Tailwind Starter Template

I made this template because I don't want to use any framework.
Sometimes just the HTML file is enough.

The project uses Tailwind CSS to make style files as simple as possible.

## Setup

It has a simple setup. After making sure npm is installed. Just run the install command.

```bash
npm install
```

Next we can run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And your website will launch.

## Changing the project

Then you can modify the `tailwind.config.js` file for your own custom style commands if needed.
And it is enough to change the 'resource/css/main.css' in the main directory.
